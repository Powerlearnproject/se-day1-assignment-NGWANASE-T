Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
its a branch of computer science used for developing, testing and maintaining software.
reliability- it ensures software performs as expected without bias especially for critical applications like healthcare 
efficiency - it helps to optimize developer workflow while maintaining high quality standards.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Mastering complexity
Mastering process
Mastering machine


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
planning - identify the software requirement or purpose and scope.
requirement analysis - identify the final user specification. 
design - building the framework. 
coding - converting software design into tangible code.
testing - examine the software for any bugs and glitches


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
-On waterfall methologies testing is done at the end of the development process while on Agile methodologies testing is continuous and done after each iteration.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
-A software developer maintaining and updating software to keep it functional. 
-A Quality Assurance Engineer confirm that the software meets the requirement before deployment.
-A Project Manager create blueprint for the project.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software platform that facilitates the creation of other software applications by providing a space to write, compile, and debug code, sometimes with value-adding tools that reduce development efforts. eg Visual Studio Code (VSCode) whilst a Version Control Systems  are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. eg Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Rapid technological advancement and a solution can be adopting continuous learning practices 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit tests ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.
 Integration tests verify if different modules or services used by your application work well together.
Acceptance tests are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors. 


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering  is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt -Draw a picture of a dog

Improved prompt- Draw a full-body portrait of a young woman with long brown hair, wearing a red jacket and blue jeans, standing in a park on a sunny day with trees and grass in the background.

The improved prompt is more effective because it provides clear details and they more detailed than the vague prompt
